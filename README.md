### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Benj Rich
I recently completed the Data Science Course at [Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly Lambda School)](https://www.bloomtech.com). I've really enjoyed learning Python over the past few years and continuing to find new things that can blow my mind and elevate the way I work. You can check out [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-c-rich/) in for more info about me ðŸ˜„

The most exciting thing I recently learned, is how to Automate Venmo payments using Venmo's API, meaning I no longer need to remember to pay my family for my phone bill ðŸŽ‰. I currently have this set up on Windows Task Scheduler, but am wanting to put it into a Lambda Function in AWS so It's fully automated, no matter the state of my computer. 

Skills: Python / SQL / Algorithms / Data Structures / Relational Databases / Postgres
